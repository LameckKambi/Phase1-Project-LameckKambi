### JavaScript Code
The JavaScript code for this project is structured as follows:
- The DOMContentLoaded event listener was used to fetch news data from the News API and create news cards dynamically.
- The createNewsCard function was used to create a news card with a title, description, image, and link.
- The forEach method was used to iterate over the articles and create news cards for each article.
- The catch method was used to handle errors that may occur during the fetch request.

To add more functionality to the project, event listeners were added to the navigation links in the header section. When a link is clicked, it takes the user to the corresponding stress relief insights. Similarly, event listeners are added to the container menu links in the footer section. When a link is clicked, it takes the user to the relevant mental health resources and stress relief activities.
